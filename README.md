# Gregg Grose

Hello, my GitHub profile was established to help with tutorials and learn GitHub/Markdown. Eventually, it will showcase my knowledge and skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live near Lake Superior and am fortunate to be able to walk the shore, finding beach glass along the way. I'm slightly colorblind and this may help differentiate glass from rock.

## Currently learning more about:
- Docs as code approach
- Semantic HTML & Accessibility
